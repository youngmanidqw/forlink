Ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah
I always knew you were the best
The coolest girl I know
So prettier than all the rest
The star of my show
So many times I wished
You'd be the one for me
But never knew you'd get like this
Girl, what you do to me?
You're who I'm thinking of
Girl you ain't my runner up
And no matter what
You're always number one
My prize possession, one and only
Adore you, girl, I want you
The one I can't live without
That's you, that's you
You're my special little lady
The one that makes me crazy
Of all the girls I've ever known
It's you, it's you
My favorite, my favorite
My favorite, my favorite girl
My favorite girl
You're used to going out your way
To impress these Mr. Wrongs
But you can be yourself with me
I'll take you as you are
I know they said believe in love
It's a dream that can't be real
So girl let's write a fairy tale
And show them how we feel
You're who I'm thinking of
Girl you ain't my runner up
And no matter what
You're always number one
My prize possession, one and only
Adore you, girl, I want you
The one I cant live without
That's you, that's you
You're my special little lady
The one that makes me crazy
Of all the girls I've ever known
It's you, it's you
My favorite, my favorite
My favorite, my favorite girl
My favorite girl
Baby it's you
My favorite, my favorite
My favorite, my favorite girl
My favorite girl
You take my breath away
With everything you say
I just wanna be with you
My baby, my baby, oh
Promise I'll play no games
Treat you no other way
Than you deserve
'Cause you're the girl of my dreams
My prize possession, one and only
Adore you, girl, I want you
The one I can't live without
That's you, that's you
You're my special little lady
The one that makes me crazy
Of all the girls I've ever known
It's you, it's you
My prize possession, one and only
Adore you, girl, I want you
The one I can't live without
That's you, that's you
You're my special little lady
The one that makes me crazy
Of all the girls I've ever known
It's you, it's you
My favorite, my favorite
My favorite, my favorite girl
My favorite girl
My favorite, my favorite
My favorite, my favorite girl
My favorite girl
Favorite girl
